Below is a table‑free, but even more detailed, walkthrough you can keep for future reference.
I’ve broken it into clear sections so you can skim or dive deep as needed.

## 1 · Why “batch” Groq Whisper‑Large‑v3 Turbo already feels instant

*Groq publishes a 216 × “real‑time factor” for Turbo*—that means the model can process 216 seconds of audio every one second of wall‑clock time ([GroqCloud][1]).
To estimate how long you’ll actually wait:

```
compute_time  =  audio_length_seconds / 216
tail_latency  =  compute_time  +  (≈0.15‑0.25 s network + JSON)
```

### What that looks like in practice

* 5 s utterance → ≈ 0.02 s compute + overhead ≈ 0.18–0.25 s
* 1‑minute utterance → ≈ 0.28 s compute + overhead ≈ 0.40–0.50 s
* 2‑minute utterance → ≈ 0.56 s compute + overhead ≈ 0.75–0.90 s
* 5‑minute rant → ≈ 1.39 s compute + overhead ≈ 1.6–2.0 s

Most users perceive anything under about half a second as “instant,” especially after they’ve just spoken for tens of seconds.

Cost is also tiny: Turbo lists at **\$0.04 per hour of audio** ([GroqCloud][1]), so a one‑minute clip costs roughly \$0.00067.

## 2 · What Deepgram streaming really buys you

Deepgram’s Nova‑3 WebSocket streams tokens while the speaker is still talking.
Marketing and community benchmarks show **first‑word latency under 300 ms** and last‑token latency roughly 300 ms after the microphone goes silent ([Deepgram][2], [GitHub][3], [Deepgram][4]).

Effectively:

* While the speaker is active, you can scroll partial words in your UI.
* Once they stop, you already have everything except that final 250‑300 ms flush.

Price is the trade‑off: the **streaming endpoint starts at \$0.0077 per minute** (≈ \$0.462 per hour) for pay‑as‑you‑go ([Deepgram][4])—over ten times Groq Turbo’s hourly rate.

Deepgram also provides extras Groq Whisper does not: optional live diarization, profanity redaction, and key‑term prompting.

## 3 · Head‑to‑head for your three common clip lengths

* **5‑second prompt**

  * Groq: waits \~180–250 ms after you finish.
  * Deepgram streaming (hidden): waits \~250–300 ms.
    → Difference is barely perceptible.

* **1‑ to 2‑minute explanation**

  * Groq: waits \~0.4–0.9 s after silence.
  * Deepgram streaming (hidden): still \~0.3 s.
    → A savings of only two‑to‑six‑tenths of a second, at 10× the cost.

* **Rare 5‑minute monologue**

  * Groq: \~1.6–2.0 s tail.
  * Deepgram streaming: \~0.3 s tail.
    → Here the gap is \~1.5 s, but that may still be fine if you are turning the text around for an LLM reply that itself answers in \~30 ms.

Unless you *show words while the user is talking* or absolutely need diarization/redaction, the economics and simplicity favor Groq Turbo.

## 4 · How to add “hidden” streaming later (if you decide you need it)

1. **Open one Deepgram WebSocket** with query params `model=nova-3&punctuate=true&interim_results=true`.
2. **Send 16 kHz mono PCM** frames as they arrive from your microphone.
3. **Buffer only frames where `is_final=true`.** Discard the partials (`is_partial=true`).
4. **Detect end‑of‑speech**—Deepgram marks the last message with `speech_final=true`, or you can add a 600 ms voice‑activity timer.
5. **As soon as silence is confirmed**, concatenate the buffered `channel.alternatives[0].transcript` strings and push to your UI. Your tail latency is then just Deepgram’s flush (\~0.3 s).
6. **Optional hybrid router**: if the clip exceeds some threshold (say 30 s), abandon the stream buffer and fall back to a single Groq Turbo batch call to save cost.

This “hidden stream” pattern still requires the WebSocket event loop, heart‑beats, back‑pressure handling, reconnection logic, and higher per‑minute billing, but it gives you the absolute lowest tail latency money can buy without actually showing the scroll of interim words.

## 5 · Chunking Groq to mimic streaming (if you prefer one provider)

You can get *near‑live* behaviour from Groq alone:

* Record overlapping 10–15 s windows (e.g., start a new chunk every 5 s).
* POST each chunk to Groq Turbo as soon as its 10 s buffer fills.
* In parallel, POST a `final_chunk` flag once voice‑activity detects silence.
* Concatenate the returned segments by timestamp offsets.
* Because each 10 s slice takes only \~50 ms compute, you can display scroll updates that lag 5–7 s behind the speaker—good enough for many captioning use‑cases, and still far cheaper than Deepgram.

## 6 · Decision template you can revisit later

Ask yourself three questions:

1. **Will my product eventually show words during speech?**
   *If yes*, plan on Deepgram streaming (or future Groq streaming once released).
   *If no*, Groq Turbo batch is usually sufficient.

2. **Do I need diarization, key‑term prompting, or redaction?**
   *If yes*, Deepgram.
   *If no*, Groq.

3. **Is \$0.0077 per minute acceptable, or is cost a top concern?**
   Remember Groq Turbo is ≈ \$0.00067 per minute.

If you answer “no” to #1 and #2 and you are price‑sensitive, stay with Groq Turbo. Implement a provider‑agnostic `transcribe()` interface now so adding a WebSocket path later is just another plugin.

### Bottom‑line take‑away

For the overwhelming majority of 5‑second to 2‑minute turns—where you only surface text after the person stops—**batch Groq Whisper‑Large‑v3 Turbo will look instantaneous to your users, cost a fraction of Deepgram, and keep your stack simpler**. Keep the streaming recipe in your back pocket for future live‑caption or diarization features, but you don’t need to pay for it today.
