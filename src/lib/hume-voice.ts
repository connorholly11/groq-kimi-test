export const HUME_VOICE_DESCRIPTION = `Male voice, mid-30s to early 40s. Not too deep, not too high - somewhere in that conversational sweet spot. A little gravelly, like someone who's had a few too many late-night conversations over coffee. Think... if Oscar Isaac had a slightly rougher edge to his voice.

Not the smooth radio announcer thing - more like the guy who's genuinely curious about what you're thinking but isn't afraid to push back when you're being evasive. A voice that can shift from gentle to direct without sounding harsh.

Maybe with just a hint of that slight vocal fry that comes from actually caring about what you're saying, not trying to sound cool. The kind of voice that makes "bullshit" sound like an observation, not an insult.`;
